### `.bashrc`
More or less a standard linux bashrc with a few useful aliases & functions added at the top - Colors are force-enabled cause I like it that way
Notable Features
- `src` and `alia` source and edit `.bashrc` respectively 
- `lc` and `cc` combine `clear` with `ls` and `cd` for a cleaner navigating experience
- `md` is a mkdir with a cd into it after creation
- `up <optional:int>` moves you up 1 directory by default or uses the int you pass it 
- `back` returns you to your previous working directory
- `sizeof` uses du to human readable size of the file you point it to 

### `upgrade_nano.sh` 
Uses [Scopatz's](https://github.com/scopatz/nanorc) installer to add more language highlighting to nano
